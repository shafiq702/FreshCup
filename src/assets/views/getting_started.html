                    <p>
                      Learn analytics is exactly what it sounds like. It's a place you can improve your analytics skills. I started doing data analytics work back during my first internship in college, before I
                      even knew what data analytics was. Since then, I've worked with many different technologies that make up the data analytics cycle. My goal is to help others
                      get to my level someday with easy to follow tutorials and practical examples.
